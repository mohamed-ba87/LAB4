        According to ancient records passed down through the centuries,
        the making of cheese dates back more than 4,000 years.
        No one really knows who made the first cheese.
        According to an ancient legend, it was made accidentally by
        an Arabian merchant who put his supply
        of milk into a pouch made from a sheep’s stomach, as he set out on a day’s journey across the desert.
        The rennet in the lining of the pouch, combined with the heat of the sun, caused the milk to separate into curd and whey.
        That night he found that the whey satisfied his thirst, and the cheese (curd) had a delightful flavor which satisfied
        his hunger
