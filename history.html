<h2> The History of Cheese </h2>
<p>
    Travelers from Asia are believed to have brought the art of Cheesemaking to Europe.
    In fact, cheese was made in many parts of the Roman Empire when it was at its height.
    The Romans, in turn, introduced cheesemaking to England. During the Middle Ages-from the
    decline of the Roman Empire until the discovery of America-cheese was made and improved
    by the monks in the monasteries of Europe. For example, Gorgonzola was made in the Po Valley
    in Italy in 879 A.D., and Italy became the cheesemaking center of Europe during the 10th Century
    . Roquefort was also mentioned in the ancient records of the monastery at Conques,
    France as early as 1070.

    Cheesemaking continued to flourish in Europe and became an established food. In fact,
    the Pilgrims included cheese in the Mayflower’s supplies when they made their voyage
    to America in 1620. The making of cheese quickly spread in the New World, but until the
    19th century it remained a local farm industry. It wasn’t until 1851 that the first
    cheese factory in the United States was built by Jesse Williams in Oneida County, New York.
